# PasuNashi

First of all, this is **NOT** a secure password manager, since key to decrypt everything on the database is stored as an environment variable on the backend server.

This is a personal project in which I put all my effort to learn a lot of technologies, some new, and some not so much, like React Hooks, Typescript, Redux and its Hooks, and many more.

I always tried to follow standards.

This is basically the same project as [Web-Forntend](https://github.com/PasuSewa/Web-Frontend), but with ElectronJS on top of that, and with a few less functionalities (the payment system, and the captcha, for example).

Whithout further ado, lets start with the documentation:

You can check out the docs generated with JsDocs on [this link](https://pasusewa.github.io/Web-Frontend/).

## How to initialize the project

First of all, you will need to properly set up the .env.local file. This projects include a .env.example file which shows what variables you need to fill up.

##### All the variables needed in the environment are the following:

1. REACT_APP_ENV_LOCAL: If there is nothing, the app will asume that the environment is "production", else, if there is anything, the app will change to "local" / "development" environment.
   <br/>
   <br/>
2. REACT_APP_USE_LOCAL_API: If empty, the app will call the production api, else, it will use http://localhost:8000/api (see src/misc/ajaxManajer.ts to change the base uri for both options).
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Once you are done with all of that, the last thing is to run

    `npm install`

    or

    `yarn install`

## Electron

**Before anything, to run these commands you must have yarn already installed in your PC.**

There are two commands that you wnat to know. First is how to run the project in the local environment:

`npm run electron:serve`

The other useful-to-know command is:

`npm run electron:build`

In order to create the installer file.
(It will create the installer required for the system you are in at the time of building).

## Folder Structure

I don't know if this is a good practise or not, but I tried keep everything as simple as possible.

Basically, all the components that don't require a unit test, and don't use styles from Material-UI, are stored in their respective file, with the name of the component as the name of the file.

Then, the components that do have a test, and / or use the Material-UI styles, are stored in a folder with the name of the component, and with the test named as `componentName.test.tsx`, and styles as `styles.ts`.

And lastly, there are a few components that aren't used outside of 1 or 2 parent components, and those are stored inside of the folder of the parent component (for example the Drawer component, which is in src/comps/Navbar/Drawer since it isn't used outside of the navbar).

## Running the Tests

In order to run the tests, you can execute the following:

`npm run test -a`

## Project Dependencies

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) - As the UI

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - For the icons

[Dexie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dexie) - To handle all the interactions with Indexed DB (I don't recomment using it, its really simple to use, but very limited in my opinion).

[react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form) - To handle all the forms

[react-qrcode-logo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qrcode-logo) - For the QR codes

[react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) - To handle the global state

[JsDocs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdocs) and [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) - For the documenation

And lastly, this is not a dependency perse, but since I had a lot of problems using the package i18n, I decided to follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtaKTDNQ6vo&list=PLXlNY59rhzeIlEiTIznuqji-ORgKjEhGa) to make the translation system.
