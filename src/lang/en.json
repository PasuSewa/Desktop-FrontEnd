Tor removes from the game all Cookies, sessions, possible attacks that web pages may attempt, etc. It's like you were browsing on the Internet from an antivirus.",
		"Unlike the apps that we've been recommending, Duck Duck Go is not an app, but rather a search engine, which differs from Google and other engines, as it doesen't offer as first results those sites that paid for advertising, or that you previously searched for (the so-called \"bubble filter\"), this hand in hand with other options and settings that support the free Internet and protect your privacy, makes it a highly recommended search engine."

I have nothing to hide... \" We have all heard or said that phrase at least once, but think about it in this way, don't you think its annoying that if one day you were talking to a friend about how you dislike having to do the dishes, and the next day you would receive 30 pamphlets in the mail with dishwasher promotions? The same thing happens on the Internet, but not with real pamphlets, but in the form of spam emails, ads on social networks, etc. Wherever you go, dishwasher ads, on Facebook, on YouTube, on other social media, and more.",

		"In the security section, we wanted to emphasize the importance of activating 2-Factor Authentication, but... what is 2-Factor Authentication?",
		"There are 3 ways to identify you, which are: by something you know (a password), by something you are (your fingerprints, your face, your pupils, etc.), and by something you have (the key to your house, your credit card, or your smartphone).",
		"Nowadays passwords are not secure anymore, there are databases on the Internet that store patterns shared by many hacked passwords, and this being the case, if a possible hacker wants to guess your password, the only thing they'll have to do is mixing those patterns that are frequently repeated, until they finds the right combination.",
		"What 2-Factor Authentication does is to increase the security by adding a \"factor\" or, to put it simpler, to build a second \"wall\" to protect your house. In this way, if someone guessed your password, they would still have to jump the second wall as they also have to get the key generated by your smartphone."
